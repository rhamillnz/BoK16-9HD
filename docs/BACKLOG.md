# Backlog

Autonomous mode: every item is one thread and one PR against `integration`; tick it here when it merges.
Reuben reviews `integration` against real data and fast-forwards `main`.

HUD screens: register through `registerHudScreen` (src/ui/hudRegistry.ts); the built-in screens live in src/ui/builtinScreens.ts. Keep src/game/main.ts to one import plus one call per feature.
